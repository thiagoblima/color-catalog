## Expo

Builing native apps for _IOS_ and _Android_ with *React Native*:

1. First of all it's needed to get *Expo CLI* installed:

```
npm install expo-cli --global
```

2. Adding _React Navigation_ to the project:

```
npm install @react-navigation/native
```

3. It should be all good to get it started through the pretty wellknown command:

```
npm start
```
